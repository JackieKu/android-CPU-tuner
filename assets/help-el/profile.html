<span class="text">Profiles are systemwide settings that are
applied by <a href="trigger.html">triggers</a>.</span>
<span class="text">At the moment (v. 1.0) there's two categories,
you can adjust:
<ul>
	<li><span class="bold">CPU settings</span><br />
	These settings determine the CPU's clockspeed ("how fast it is") and
	power consumption.</li>
	<li><span class="bold">services</span><br />
	These settings can toggle some system services on and/or off.<br />
	As said in <a href="battery_drainer.html">battery drainers</a> it's
	wise to disable syncing, wifi, etc. on some states.<br />
	You can <span class="bold">leave [the service in question]
	unchanged</span>, but you may as well <span class="bold">enable</span> or 
	<span class="bold">disable</span> services with triggers, additionally you can
	go <span class="bold">back to [the] previous</span> state which activates the state 
	the service was in before the last switch.
		
		<br />
	If you manually override these settings, e.g. cause CPU tuner disables
	sync at 20% battery, but you need to sync you calendar with Google,
	this setting will stay untouched by CPU tuner unless a new trigger is
	activated and modifies the service's state.</li>
</ul>
