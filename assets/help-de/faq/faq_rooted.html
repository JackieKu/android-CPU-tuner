	<span class="text">
		If you <span class="bold">have rooted</span> your phone, it may be that you overlooked to grant CPU tuner root permission when opening it.<br/>
		You should open your <span class="italic">Superuser</span> app and check out CPU tuner's permissions.

	<span class="text">
		If you <span class="bold">haven't rooted</span> your phone, you'll need to root it, if you want to use CPU tuner.<br/>
		I would advise agains rooting your phone, tho!<br/>
		Rooting a phone has the potential to break the device/software on the device and unless you have good reasons to root it, don't do it.<br/>
		Personally I do not consider CPU tuner a "good reason"!<br/>
		Consider that rooting your device will void it's warranty!
