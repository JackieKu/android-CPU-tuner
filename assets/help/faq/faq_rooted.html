<h3>It says it not rooted...</h3>
<p>
There are two cases that are possible:
</p>
<h4>The device is rooted</h4>
<p>
When opening CPU tuner you get asked if you want to allow root access and
you have to grant root access in oder for CPU tuner to work correctly.<br>
There should be an app called <i>Superuser</i> open it and check if CPU tuner is
granted root access.
</p>
</p>
<h4>The device is NOT rooted...</h4>
<a name="howto" ></a><h4>Howto root the device?</h4>
<p>
You did not root your device.<br>
In this case I would NOT advice you to root the Device!
<br>
Rooting a phone has potential to break it and unless you have very good
reasons (I would not consider CPU tuner as a good reason.) 
and are confident about it, I would not do it.<br>
You will void you warranty and potentially nobody is going to help you
if something is going wrong.
