<span class="text">Virtual governors are an abstraction of the 
<a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> and their parameters.</span>
<span class="text">Since a significant part of the energy saving is done by the
parameters of the <a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> switching only
the <a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> of a <a href="profile.html">profile</a>
does (most of the time) not make much sense.
</span>
<span class="text">For more information on the parameters of the  
<a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> see the detailed information of the respective governor.</span>
<span class="text">
If the userlevel power user is chosen, there is the additional possibility to run a shell script (or a shell command)
after the switching of the governor.
