<span class="text">Virtual governors are an abstraction of the 
<a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> and their parameters.</span>
<span class="text">Since a significant part of the energy saving is done by the
parameters of the <a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> switching only
the CPU governors of a <a href="profile.html">profile</a>
does (most of the time) not make much sense.
</span>
<span class="text">The most important parameters are the thresholds of the ondemand and conservative 
governors, they are given in percent of the system load and tell the governor when to increase the 
frequency (up threshold) or decrease the frequency (down threshold).<br>
For more information on the parameters of the  
<a href="cpufreq/governor.html">CPU governors</a> see the detailed information of the respective governor.</span>
<span class="text">
If the userlevel power user is chosen, there is the additional possibility to run a shell <span class="bold">script</span> (or a shell command)
after the switching of the governor.  The commands entered there will parsed by a shell and executed as root.
