<h3>cpu tuner help</h3>
<p>
CPU tuner uses a concept of <a href="trigger.html">triggers</a> and 
<a href="profile.html">profiles</a>.
<br>
Depending on the state of the device a
<a href="trigger.html">trigger</a> applies a 
<a href="profile.html">profile</a>.
</p>
<p>
The state of the device consists of the battery level and whether the device
is locked or on power.<br>  
The <a href="profile.html">profile</a> is a set of policies that will be applied if a profile gets activated
(by a trigger).
</p>
<p>
CPU tuner does not constantly run and poll, but it gets activated by events 
sent by the android system.
