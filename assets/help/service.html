<span class="text">
	Service switches can be a key to save battery, but you should not switch services too often 
	since this can use more battery than it saves.
	As said in <a href="battery_drainer.html">battery drainers</a> it's
	wise to disable syncing, wifi, etc. on some states
</span>
<span class="text">	
	The following switch states are possible:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">leave unchanged</span><br/>
			Does not change the state of the service. 
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">enable</span><br/>
			Enables the service (i.e. switches it on).
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">disable</span><br/>
			Disables the service (i.e. switches it off).
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">back to previous</span><br/>
			Switches back to the previous state set by cpu tuner.  This overwrites changes
			that were made outside of cpu tuner.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">pulse</span><br/>
			A <span class="bold">pulse</span>d service will be switched off for some time (e.g. 15 min),
			then automatically switched on for a (short) period (e.g. 1min).
			After this the cycle begins again. <br/> 
			All pulsed services will be switch on and off at the same time.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</span>
<span class="text">	
	Cpu tuner can be set to allow <span class="bold">manual service changes</span> in settings, in this
	case manually changed services will not be switched again unless a new trigger occurs.
</span>	
<span class="text">	
	The following services are supported:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">Mobiledata 2G/3G (2/3G)</span><br/>
			Changes the type of the mobiledata connection.  Switching changes 
			the bandwidth (i.e. speed) of your connection, you still will be able to
			receive data but slower (or faster).
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Mobiledata connenction (MD)</span><br/>
			Switches the mobiledata connection on and off.  If switched off no data from and to the
			mobilenetwork will be transfered. Wireless networtks will work.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Background sync (sync)</span><br/>
			Tell the system not do background syncing.  Some apps might not honour this setting
			and continue to sync its data.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Wireless (wifi)</span><br/>
			Switch the wireless interface on and off.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Bluetooth (BT)</span><br/>
			Switch bluetooth on and off.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">GPS receiver (GPS)</span><br/>
			Switch the GPS receiver on and off. <br>
			This only works when installed as system app.
			</li>
		</ul>
