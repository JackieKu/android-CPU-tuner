<h3>Governor</h3>
<p>
The governor determines how the <a href="frequency.html">frequencies</a> 
of the cpu are set.
</p>
<p>
Common governors include (as explained by the linux kernel):
<li><b>Ondemand</b><br>
Dynamically changes frequency based on the CPU utilization with a focus on performance.
</li>
<li><b>Conservative</b><br>
Dynamically changes frequency based on the CPU utilization with a focus on saving power.
</li>
<li><b>Performance</b><br>
Sets the frequency statically to the highest available CPU frequency.
</li>
<li><b>Powersave</b><br>
Sets the frequency statically to the lowest available CPU frequency.
</li>
<li><b>Userspace</b><br>
Sets the frequency statically to the given frequency.
</li>
<li><b>Interactive</b><br>
Designed for low latency burst workloads. Scaling is done when coming out of idle instead of polling.
</li>
