<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>
The frequency your CPU is clocked on.
</p>
<p>
High frequencies use more power yields in 
a empty battery at the end.
</p>
<p>
Low frequencies use less power but your device gets slow.
Frequencies below 400 MHz have been reported to prevent you phone from
coming out of the sleep state (i.e. not beeing able to switch the phone on again).
</p>
<p>
There are other <a href="../battery_drainer.html">sources</a>  which consume battery.
