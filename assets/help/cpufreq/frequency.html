<h3>Frequency</h3>
<p>
Your CPU's clockspeed ("how fast it is").
</p>
<p>
The higher, the faster and smoother your phone will run.
	<p>
	Keep in mind that high(er) frequencies drain your battery faster, as the CPU works more ("harder") and needs a higher core voltage to operate properly.
	Thereby overclocking leads to more heat, which might damage your phone. Be warned!
	<p>
	In reverse this means that your phone will run slower when underclocked, but it will use less energy, which results in a prolonged battery life.
	Clocking too low (<400MHz) may lead to your phone being locked in "sleep" mode - you cannot switch it on with a button-press anymore.
	This is one of the reasons, why clocking below that speed is available in "poweruser" mode only.
	<p>
	If you're out to extend your battery uptime, you might want to have a look at other common <a href="../battery_drainer.html">battery drainers</a>.
