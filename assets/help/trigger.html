<h3>Triggers</h3>
<p>
A trigger defines what <a href="profile.html">profile</a> should be activated.
</p>
<p>
CPU tuner activates the trigger that has the biggest battery level which is 
still smaller than the devices current battery level.
</p>
<p>
Depending on the state of the device a profile is chosen.<br>
The states are evaluated in the following order:
<li><b>Screen off</b><br>
If the screen is off this profile is chosen.
</li>
<li><b>AC Power</b><br>
If the device is connected to a external power source this profile is chosen.
</li>
<li><b>Battery</b><br>
The battery profile is chosen, if no other state is valid.
</li>
</p>
<p>
CPU tuner does not constantly run and poll those states, but it gets activated 
by events concerning those states sent by the android system.
