	<span class="text">A trigger defines the phone's state when to and the <a href="profile.html">profile</a> to load on reaching this state.</span>
	<span class="text">CPU tuner activates the trigger that has the biggest battery level which is still smaller than the devices current battery level.</span>
	<span class="text">
		Depending on the state of the device a profile is chosen.<br>
		The states are evaluated in the following order:
		<ul>
			<li><span class="bold">Call in progress</span><br/>
			If this profile exists and a phone call is active profile is chosen. <br/>
			This state can be enable/disabled in the settings.
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Battery hot</span><br/>
			If this profile exists and the battery is hot this profile is chosen. 
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">Screen locked</span><br/>
			If the screen is off this profile is chosen.  
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">AC Power</span><br/>
			If the device is connected to a external power source this profile is chosen.  
			</li>
			<li><span class="bold">On Battery</span><br/>
			The battery profile is chosen, if no other state is valid.  
			</li>
		</ul>
	</span>
	<span class="text">
	The sequence in which the profiles are chosen is:<br/>
	Call in progress, Battery hot, Screen locked, AC Power and finally On Battery. <br/>
	The first match is taken. 
	</span>
	<span class="text">CPU tuner does not constantly run and poll those states, 
	but it gets activated by events concerning those states sent by the android system.</span>
