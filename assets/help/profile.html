<h3>Profiles</h3>
<p>
Profiles define settings that are applied by the <a href="trigger.html">triggers</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are two types of settings:
<li><b>CPU settings</b><br>
These setting determine the power consumption and the responsiveness of the CPU.
</li>
<li><b>Services</b><br>
These setting allow you to switch services (like mobiledata, syncing, wifi) which
consume a lot of power.
</p>

<h4>CPU settings</h4>
<p>
The CPU tuning part of CPU tuner is a front end to the linux kernel <a href="cpufreq/cpufreq.html">cpufreq interface</a>.
</p>
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>
CPU tuner allows you to switch the state of battery consuming services.<br>
You can choose between three options: <br>
<li><b>Leave unchanged</b><br>
The state of this service will not be changed by this profile.
</li>
<li><b>Enable</b><br>
The service will be enabled.
</li>
<li><b>Disable</b><br>
The service will be disabled.
</li>
</p>
<p>
In case you enable <i>Manual service changes</i> in settings/system
changes of service states will only happen if the state is not changed
for outside of CPU tuner or if a new trigger is started.<br>
E.g. if a profile of a trigger switches background sync to off and you switch it 
back on, it will stay on until a new trigger activates a profile that siwtches it 
again.
