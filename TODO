- why do we get 2 profile switches each time?
- ask for name when closing editor or do not save (avoid identical names as well) configuration/trigger/profile/virtgov
- configurations autoload actionbar

- long-pressing a profile and choosing "insert" would insert a new profile cloned with the settings of the long-pressed one

- move install level from default preferences to other non backuped preferences

- if no gov get current gov or try to set governors

* make autoload restoreable and decouple it from configs 

- move settings to new layout

- branch actionbar

- hide frequencies for beginners (and state clearly in market)

- show long description of configs

- triggers cannot have to same battery level

- handle two configuration have the same name

- Imperial units (Â°C -> F)

- action bar for editors

- animate pulsed service in list

- fragments: fix orientation change 

- move logging to file or logcat
