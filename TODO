- fix orientation change in virtual gov editor
- helppage for configurations
- save configuration on switch
- show configuration in main screen
- switch profile/triggers sets (everything) based on time

- I think it would be a good help to have a log of the last x profile changes on the statistics screen, giving timestamp, profile and trigger.


- enable/disable services in settings

- move load profile to task
- use sprintf to display time in state

- widget for profile switch
- Imperial units (Â°C -> F)

- animate pulsed service in list
- icons for services

- do not change bt while paired -> setting
  
- set brightness
- set a black wall paper (and honor live wallpapers)

- figure out how to get avail freqs (if not available)

- Feature request: CPU temperature monitoring in addition to battery 
- change profile in mainview even if profiles switching is not active
