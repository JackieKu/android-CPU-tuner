- buy me a beer

- better default values
- apply default settings
- figure out how to get avail freqs (if not available)
- make power consumption calculation configurable

- check capabilities in thread
- make capabilitycheck work for 2 freqs only... comine checks into one (for ondemand, conservative etc...)
- make capabilitycheck check for governor thresholds
- get min freq setting from default and use it as min possible freq (except for powersave)

- ensure 100% battery profile present

Postponed:  (post 1.0)

- do not read thresholds if governor has none
- keep track of governors thresholds
- ondemand/down_differential ... ? (tobi)
- wait some time before checking changed settings in capability check
- Battery hot state
- choose state sequence
