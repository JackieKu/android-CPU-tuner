- 3G only mobiledata setting

- virtual governors (incl. thresholds) for inexperienced users
- make logging less noisy

- choose percedence of states
- backup restore profiles
  
 
- set brightness
- set a black wall paper (and honour live wallpapers)

- switch off mobile data
- Scheduled background sync: We need an option to have data & sync turn on at regular intervals while screen off in order to keep receiving (turn on data for say 5s than off for 30s) 
- Active traffic must not cut data connection: Maybe you've built this in already and I just didn't realize it but it's essential that neither mobile data nor wifi ever gets cut while there's data traffic (e.g. >5kb/s) going on. Otherwise sync, downloads, VOIP calls will get interrupted. 

- populate db in thread

- figure out how to get avail freqs (if not available)
- check profile version
- implement power consumption clearing for profiles (check for modification)
- do not change bt while paired -> setting
